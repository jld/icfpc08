This is the 2008 ICFP Programming Competition submission of the
team Celestial Dire Badger (i.e., me).

The original README file from the submission, which explains the
techniques used and which parts of the code do what (with an
unusually high level of clarity and detail, as these things go),
has been moved to README.icfp so that people wandering across this
on github will be less confused -- it was meant to be read by the
contest organizers, who'd have all the relevant context, whereas
this new audience might first need to read the contest website at
http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/2008IcfpContest/ in order to make
any sense of it.
